        <p id="rules">Once the die has randomly chosen you a letter, the timer will begin. Players attempt to create
          an answer that begins with the letter on the die for each of the categories on their list.
          Articles (A/An/The) do not fulfill the beginning letter requirement. Instead , the word following the
          article will be the letter that counts. For instance , if the letter was “W” and the category was “TV Shows,”
          The Walking Dead would count as an <span class="bold">acceptable</span> answer; however, the answer would be <span class="bold">unacceptable</span> if a “T” had been
          rolled. Players cannot use the same answer twice in the same round , even if it would otherwise be acceptable.
          Last names can be used first , for example “Bush, George” as an answer for a US President beginning with “B.” <br>

          Scoring will depend on whether one player's answers match anothers. Be Creative! You can be flexible in your answers ,
          but remember grammar and spelling count! You will not be awarded for leaving a question blank or not following the rules above.
          When answering a question, ask yourself if this choice is a plain and common one. If it popped into your head in a second , chances
          are it probably is. If you see time running out, leave it and continue down the list. If you have any time remaining , go back and
          swap out your answers for more complex ones. This will increase your chances at winning over your opponent. Good luck!
