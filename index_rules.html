        <p id="rules">Once the die has randomly chosen you a letter, the timer will begin. Players attempt to create
          an answer that begins with the letter on the die for each of the categories on their list.
          Articles (A/An/The) do not fulfill the beginning letter requirement. Instead, the word following the
          article will be the letter that counts. For instance, if the letter was “W” and the category was “TV Shows,”
          The Walking Dead would count as an acceptable answer; however, the answer would be unacceptable if a “T” had been
          rolled. Players cannot use the same answer twice in the same round, even if it would otherwise be acceptable.
          Last names can be used first, for example “Bush, George” as an answer for a US President beginning with “B.”</p>
